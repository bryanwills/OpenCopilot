Looking to implement a system where a user's input prompt is used to perform a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) search across all defined workflows, and then execute the workflow that is most similar to the user's input. 
1. **User Input Prompt:**
   Receive the user's input prompt.

2. **MMR Search:**
   Use your language model (like the Large Language Model, LLM) to perform an MMR search across all workflows. Generate a similarity score between each workflow description and the user's input prompt. MMR helps you balance relevance and diversity, so you're not only getting the most relevant workflow, but also a diverse set of workflows.

3. **Sort Workflows:**
   Sort the workflows based on the generated similarity scores in descending order. The workflow with the highest similarity score is likely the most relevant to the user's input.

4. **Execute Workflow:**
   Execute the steps of the most similar workflow. This might involve running API calls, functions, or any other kind of automated task that the workflow involves.

Tomorrow's strategy is about making things smoother. After you pinpoint the workflow you need, you can pick out the right APIs from the Swagger specification. Think of it like sorting out puzzle pieces of different colors and shapes. Once you have this organized, you can hand it over to the agent to work with. Remember, Swagger is like a collection of instructions in a colorful and clear picture book. You're just choosing the pages you need and giving them to the agent to follow.
