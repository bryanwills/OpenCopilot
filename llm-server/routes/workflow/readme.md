Looking to implement a system where a user's input prompt is used to perform a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) search across all defined workflows, and then execute the workflow that is most similar to the user's input. 
1. **User Input Prompt:**
   Receive the user's input prompt.

2. **MMR Search:**
   Use your language model (like the Large Language Model, LLM) to perform an MMR search across all workflows. Generate a similarity score between each workflow description and the user's input prompt. MMR helps you balance relevance and diversity, so you're not only getting the most relevant workflow, but also a diverse set of workflows.

3. **Sort Workflows:**
   Sort the workflows based on the generated similarity scores in descending order. The workflow with the highest similarity score is likely the most relevant to the user's input.

4. **Execute Workflow:**
   Execute the steps of the most similar workflow. This might involve running API calls, functions, or any other kind of automated task that the workflow involves.

## Usage Guide
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import ElasticsearchStore

# Create a list of documents with short strings and metadata
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="Your short string here",
        metadata={"metadata_field1": "value1", "metadata_field2": "value2"},
    ),
    # Add more documents as needed
]

# Instantiate the vector store with the documents and embeddings library
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents(docs, embeddings, index_name="your_index_name", es_url="your_es_url")

# Provide information about the metadata fields and document contents
metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name="metadata_field1",
        description="Description of metadata_field1",
        type="string or list[string]",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="metadata_field2",
        description="Description of metadata_field2",
        type="string",
    ),
]
document_content_description = "Description of the document contents"

# Create the self-querying retriever
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)

# Use the retriever to embed the short string with metadata into the vector store
retriever.get_relevant_documents("Your query here")
