Looking to implement a system where a user's input prompt is used to perform a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) search across all defined workflows, and then execute the workflow that is most similar to the user's input. 
1. **User Input Prompt:**
   Receive the user's input prompt.

2. **MMR Search:**
   Use your language model (like the Large Language Model, LLM) to perform an MMR search across all workflows. Generate a similarity score between each workflow description and the user's input prompt. MMR helps you balance relevance and diversity, so you're not only getting the most relevant workflow, but also a diverse set of workflows.

3. **Sort Workflows:**
   Sort the workflows based on the generated similarity scores in descending order. The workflow with the highest similarity score is likely the most relevant to the user's input.

4. **Execute Workflow:**
   Execute the steps of the most similar workflow. This might involve running API calls, functions, or any other kind of automated task that the workflow involves.
